  <h2>Earthquake Facts from <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/cool-earthquake-facts">usgs.gov</a>
  </h2>

<ul>
  <li>The first “pendulum seismoscope” to measure the shaking of the ground during an earthquake was developed in 1751</li>
  <li>It wasn’t until 1855 that faults were recognized as the source of earthquakes.</li> 
  <li>The <i>epicenter</i> of an earthquake is the location directly above the hypocenter on the surface of the earth.</li> 
  <li>The <i>hypocenter </i>of an earthquake is the location beneath the earth’s surface where the rupture of the fault begins</li> 
  <li>It is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt, and 100 of them cause damage.</li> 
  <li>The <i>magnitude</i> of an earthquake is a measured value of the earthquake size. The magnitude is the same no matter where you are, or how strong or weak the shaking was in various locations.</li>  
  <li>The <i>intensity</i> of an earthquake is a measure of the shaking created by the earthquake, and this value does vary with location.</li> 
</ul>
